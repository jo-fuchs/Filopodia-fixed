# Branching_fixed
Branching Analysis of fixed DIV1 neurons measured via NeuronJ


Goals:

   - primary summary statistics for each neuron (Numbers and lengths of all categories)
   - secondary statistic for each neuron (Filopodia / length, Branches / length, Mean lengths, Total lengths, Max length, Axon/Dendrite Ratio)
   - Create summary Figures
 
requires data created through: ImageJ plugin NeuronJ - tracing measurements exported as .txt or .csv
